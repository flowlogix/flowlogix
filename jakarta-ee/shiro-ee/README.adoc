Shrio-EE feature set

* Able to Annotate CDI and EJB (local & remote) beans with @RequiresXXX
and thus protect them
* Able to use CDI @Session / ViewScoped beans in Shrio-native sessions
* Automatically configure Shiro without anything in web.xml (via Context
listeners)
* Support for automatic no-loss of form data when session expires
* Automatic turn on /off of SSL filter in JSF production/development
mode
* Automatic SSL URLs when proxied via haproxy / Apache
* Mitigate JSF VIewExpiredException automatically (basically never
throws it)
* Works with JSF Client state saving and Server state saving
* Basically, itâ€™s Shiro on steroids when used with Jakarta EE stack as
opposed to changing the way Shiro works by integrating CD
