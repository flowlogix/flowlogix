[[section-introduction]]
== Introduction to Flow Logix Maven Parent POM
Dramatically simplifies the development of applications by using the parent POM. +
Supports Maven 4 and 3.

[[section-overview]]
== Project Overview

The `base-pom` project is a Maven project that provides a collection of parent POMs designed to streamline the development and build process for Java-based applications. It establishes a consistent foundation by defining common configurations, dependencies, and best practices that can be inherited by other projects.

The project is organized into the following modules:

- `checkstyle`: Provides Checkstyle configurations to enforce a consistent code style.
- `infra-pom`: An opinionated infrastructure POM that includes configurations for testing, code coverage, and dependency management.
- `payara-pom`: A pre-configured environment for running integration tests with Payara Server.

== Modules

=== `checkstyle`

This module contains the Checkstyle dependencies and configuration files. By inheriting from this POM, projects can ensure a consistent code style and quality across the entire codebase.

=== `infra-pom`

The `infra-pom` module is an opinionated infrastructure POM that provides a robust foundation for building and testing Java applications. It includes the following features:

- *Testing*: Configures Surefire and Failsafe plugins for unit and integration testing, with support for parallel test execution.
- *Code Coverage*: Integrates with JaCoCo to measure and report code coverage.
- *Dependency Management*: Manages common dependencies, such as Jakarta EE, Lombok, and Mockito.
- *Release Management*: Simplifies the release process with pre-configured profiles for deploying to various repositories.

=== `payara-pom`

The `payara-pom` module provides a pre-configured environment for running integration tests with Payara Server. It offers several profiles to support different testing scenarios:

- `payara-server-local`: For running tests against a local Payara Server instance.
- `payara-server-remote`: For running tests against a remote Payara Server instance.
- `payara-docker`: For running tests in a Docker container.

== CI/CD

The project provides GitHub Actions for other projects. The workflows are defined in the `.github/workflows` directory and include the following:

- `dependabot-automerge-self.yml`: This workflow automatically approves and merges pull requests created by Dependabot.
- `dependabot-automerge.yml`: This reusable workflow performs the actual auto-merge process. This workflow can be reused by other projects in other organizations. It includes steps to:
- Approve the pull request.
- Wait for external checks (e.g., Jenkins, Snyk) to complete.
- Merge the pull request if all checks pass.

[[section-questions]]
== Frequently Asked Questions
Q: Is this just for Flow Logix, or can I use it for my own projects? +
A: This is a general-purpose parent POM that can be used for any project. It is not specific to Flow Logix. You can override the default settings to suit your project's name, developers, scm or any other section necessary to customize it for your own project.

Q: Which one do I choose? `infra`, `payara` or `base`? +
A: The `base` POM is minimal and can be used for any project. The `infra` POM is opinionated with many features and preconfigured defaults, while the `payara` POM is for projects that use Payara Platform. If you are not sure which one to use, start with the `base` POM.

Q: I already have a parent POM, can I use this one? +
A: Yes, you can use this POM as a parent POM for your project's parent POM. Then, you can remove all the dependencies and plugins that you do not need. This POM is designed to be flexible and can be used as a starting point for your own parent POM.

Q: How often is this updated? +
A: This POM is updated regularly to keep up with the latest versions of the dependencies and plugins. Most of the time, it is updated weekly.
